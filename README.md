# hello-world

This is my first repository! To be honest, I really don't know what I'm doing, but I'm excited to see what happens with this over time. Right now I am a 7th grade math teacher, but am looking to make a career change into computer programming. It is a little daunting with a full time job, two young kids, and a wife to spend time with, but I know that it will be worth it in the end. Any help I can get will be appreciated, and I'm excited to jump right in.
